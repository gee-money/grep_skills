GREP SKILLS CLASS - LAB NOTES


# What if we have a big log with lots of unwanted assets and want to clean it up?
# Here is a method of extracting data for just one asset in this scan log:
																					#
cd ./custdata-local/196199															# scan.log is in this folder
grep -v '10.50.254.25' scan.log > 10.50.254.25.log									# 2215/2564 lines kept
																					# You can get logs on several assets at once by fgrep 'this| that' type searches
																					# Or you can make several logs and append them  
																					# Or you can grep -R to recurse a whole folder or tree of folders
																					# Eyes on the target asset only.
																					#
grep -v 'NOT VULNERABLE' 10.50.254.25.log  > 10.50.254.25.scrub1.log 				# Remove uninteresting lines --100 or so 
																					# I might do the next step  several times with different search strings,  
																					# saving more logfiles named *.scrub2.log *.scrub3.log  to preserve my order of removing unwwanted data. 
																					# So just in case i remove too much by accident, I can back out
																					#
fgrep -i  'java' 10.50.254.25.log  >10.50.254.25.java								# Looking to confirm a java misfingerprint
fgrep -i 'Skipping vuln check' 10.50.254.25.log  >10.50.254.25.skipped-vcks			# Are all our Java checks skipped? 
fgrep -i  'filtered' 10.50.254.25.log  >10.50.254.25.filtered-ports					# FW? (Yes, 1080 ports are being filtered).
fgrep -i  'solaris 11' 10.50.254.25.log 											# Get the system fingerprint for case notes
fgrep -i  'solaris' 10.50.254.25.log > 10.50.254.25.solaris.log 					# get all checks with solaris in their name, plus lots of other stuff
																					# Many important lines will not refer to the target host IP, so make sure you look at the original file too!
